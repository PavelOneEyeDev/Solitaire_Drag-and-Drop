# Solitaire_Drag-and-Drop
 A small Unity project that implements basic Drag and Drop mechanics for Solitaire

# Warning
This project does not implement the game logic of Solitaire (it does not implement the suit of cards or their types. There is also no logic for turning cards over). This project was primarily focused on implementing the Drag and Drop mechanic and the interaction of cards from the deck with other stacks.
